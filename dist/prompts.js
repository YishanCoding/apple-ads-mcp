Follow these steps:

1. **Get the full campaign snapshot** using get_campaign_snapshot (campaignId: ${campaignId}, dateRange: "${dateRange ?? "LAST_30_DAYS"}").

2. **Analyze the data** and report on:
   - **Budget health**: Is the campaign under-spending or over-spending vs daily budget? Days until budget exhaustion?
   - **Cost efficiency**: Is CPA trending up or down? How does it compare across ad groups?
   - **Keyword performance**: Which keywords have high spend but low conversions (waste)? Which have great CPA but low impression share (opportunity)?
   - **Search term quality**: Are there search terms with high spend and zero installs that should be added as negatives? Any high-converting terms not yet added as exact keywords?
   - **Ad group balance**: Are all ad groups contributing, or is spend concentrated in one?

3. **Provide specific recommendations** with concrete actions:
   - Keywords to pause (high CPA, no conversions)
   - Keywords to increase bids (good CPA, low impression share)
   - Search terms to add as negative keywords (wasteful)
   - Search terms to add as exact match keywords (high converting)
   - Budget adjustments needed
   - Any structural issues (too few keywords, missing negatives, etc.)

1. **Pull keyword performance** using get_keyword_report (campaignId: ${campaignId}${adGroupId ? `, adGroupId: ${adGroupId}` : ""}, last 30 days, sorted by localSpend, limit 200).

2. **Pull search term data** using get_search_term_report (same params).

3. **Analyze and categorize keywords**:
   - **Pause candidates**: Keywords with spend > $5 and zero installs in 30 days, or CPA > ${targetCPA ? `${parseFloat(targetCPA) * 3}` : "3x account average"}
   - **Bid increase candidates**: Keywords with CPA < ${targetCPA ?? "account average"} AND impression share < 50% (check insights.impressionShare in raw data)
   - **Bid decrease candidates**: Keywords with CPA > ${targetCPA ?? "account average"} but still converting (don't pause, just lower bid)

4. **Analyze search terms**:
   - **New keyword candidates**: Search terms with installs > 0 and good CPA that aren't already targeting keywords (add as EXACT)
   - **Negative keyword candidates**: Search terms with spend > $2 and zero installs (block as negatives)
   - **Irrelevant terms**: Search terms that don't match the app's intent

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Verify the app**: Use get_app_details (adamId: ${adamId}) to confirm the app name and details.

2. **Check eligibility**: Use get_app_eligibility (adamId: ${adamId}, countriesOrRegions: [${countries.split(",").map(c => `"${c.trim()}"`).join(", ")}]) to verify the app can run ads in target markets.

3. **Create the campaign**: Use create_campaign with:
   - adamId: ${adamId}
   - countriesOrRegions: [${countries.split(",").map(c => `"${c.trim()}"`).join(", ")}]
   - dailyBudgetAmount: "${dailyBudget}"

4. **Create an ad group**: Use create_ad_group with a reasonable default bid based on the app category (typically $0.50-$2.00 for most categories).

5. **Suggest keywords**: Based on the app name and category, suggest 10-20 initial keywords:
   - 5-10 brand/exact terms (app name, developer name)
   - 5-10 category/discovery terms (BROAD match)
   - Suggest starting bids for each

Follow these steps:

1. **Get cross-campaign budget analysis** using get_budget_analysis (dateRange: "${dateRange ?? "LAST_30_DAYS"}").

2. **Identify reallocation opportunities**:
   - **Over-spending, under-performing**: Campaigns with high CPA relative to the account average that are consuming a large share of total spend. These should have budgets reduced.
   - **Under-spending, high-performing**: Campaigns with low CPA and strong conversion rates but hitting daily budget caps early. These deserve more budget.
   - **Inactive spend**: Campaigns with significant budget but very low impressions or taps — may indicate poor keyword targeting or paused ad groups consuming budget allocation.

3. **Propose specific budget changes**:
   - For each campaign that needs adjustment, show the current dailyBudgetAmount vs the proposed new value.
   - Ensure total daily spend across campaigns stays the same (budget-neutral reallocation) unless I indicate otherwise.
   - Generate the exact update_campaign tool calls with new dailyBudgetAmount values.

4. **Summarize the expected impact**: Estimate how CPA and install volume would change based on historical efficiency of each campaign.

Follow these steps:

2. **Check for rejections** using find_ad_rejection_reasons (campaignId: ${campaignId}).

3. **Analyze creative performance**:
   - **Winning creatives**: Ads with the best tap-through rate (TTR) and conversion rate. These are your best performers — consider scaling them to more ad groups.
   - **Losing creatives**: Ads with significantly worse TTR or CPA than the campaign average. Consider pausing these.
   - **Statistical confidence**: Flag any ads with too few impressions to draw reliable conclusions.

4. **Handle rejected creatives**:
   - For each rejected ad, explain the likely rejection reason based on Apple's creative guidelines.
   - Suggest specific fixes to get the creative approved.

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Which ads to pause (with update_ad calls)
   - Which creative variations to test next based on what's working
   - Whether the campaign would benefit from more creative diversity

2. **Get campaign details** using get_campaign_details (campaignId: ${campaignId}) to find the app's adamId and current countriesOrRegions.

3. **Rank current markets** by efficiency:
   - Best markets: Low CPA, high conversion rate, strong install volume
   - Worst markets: High CPA, low conversion rate, or negligible volume
   - For underperforming markets, recommend whether to reduce bids, pause, or remove them

4. **Identify expansion candidates**:
   - Based on the app's category and current top-performing regions, suggest promising new markets.
   - Use get_app_eligibility to verify the app can run ads in each suggested market.
   - Consider language/cultural similarity to current top markets.

5. **Recommend an expansion plan**:
   - Which new countries to add (with eligibility confirmed)
   - Suggested starting daily budgets per new market (based on CPA in similar existing markets)
   - Whether to create separate campaigns per region or add countries to existing campaigns
   - Generate specific create_campaign or update_campaign tool calls
